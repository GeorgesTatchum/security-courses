DNS use UDP 53 port by default

There are many types of DNS records:

- **A record**: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set `example.com` to resolve to `172.17.2.172`.
- **AAAA Record**: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting; neither falls under DNS.
- **CNAME Record**: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, `www.example.com` can be mapped to `example.com` or even to `example.org`.
- **MX Record**: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

You can look up the WHOIS records of any registered domain name using one of the online services or via the command-line tool `whois`, available on Linux systems, among others. As expected, a WHOIS record provides information about the entity that registered a domain name, including name, phone number, email, and address.

## SMTP

The analogy for the SMTP protocol is when you go to the local post office to send a package. You greet the employee, tell them where you want to send your package, and provide the sender’s information before handing them the package. Depending on the country you are in, you might be asked to show your identity card. This process is not very different from an SMTP session.

Let’s present some of the commands used by your mail client when it transfers an email to an SMTP server:

- `HELO` or `EHLO` initiates an SMTP session
- `MAIL FROM` specifies the sender’s email address
- `RCPT TO` specifies the recipient’s email address
- `DATA` indicates that the client will begin sending the content of the email message
- `.` is sent on a line by itself to indicate the end of the email message

The SMTP server listens on TCP port **25** by default.

## POP3

The Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is designed to allow the client to communicate with a mail server and retrieve email messages. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope or package to the post office, and POP3 is similar to checking your local mailbox for new letters or packages.

Some common POP3 commands are:

- `USER` <username> identifies the user
- `PASS` <password> provides the user’s password
- `STAT` requests the number of messages and total size
- `LIST` lists all messages and their sizes
- `RETR <message_number>` retrieves the specified message
- `DELE <message_number>` marks a message for deletion
- `QUIT` ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

The POP3 server listens on TCP port 110 by default

## IMAP

IMAP allows synchronizing read, moved, and deleted messages. IMAP is quite convenient when you check your email via multiple clients. Unlike POP3, which tends to minimize server storage as email is downloaded and deleted from the remote server, IMAP tends to use more storage as email is kept on the server and synchronized across the email clients.

The IMAP protocol commands are more complicated than the POP3 protocol commands. We list a few examples below:

- `LOGIN <username> <password>` authenticates the user
- `SELECT <mailbox>` selects the mailbox folder to work with
- `FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name>` Example fetch 3 body[] to fetch message number 3, header and body.
- `MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox>` moves the specified messages to another mailbox
- `COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name>` copies the specified messages to another mailbox
- `LOGOUT` logs out

## TLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is added to existing protocols to protect communication confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Consequently, HTTP, POP3, SMTP, and IMAP become HTTPS, POP3S, SMTPS, and IMAPS, where the appended “S” stands for Secure.

Like SSL, its predecessor, TLS is a cryptographic protocol operating at the OSI model’s transport layer. It allows secure communication between a client and a server over an insecure network. By secure, we refer to confidentiality and integrity; TLS ensures that no one can read or modify the exchanged data. Please take a minute to think about what it would be like to do online shopping, online banking, or even online messaging and email without being able to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the network packets. Without TLS, we would be unable to use the Internet for many applications that are now part of our daily routine.

The first step for every server (or client) that needs to identify itself is to get a signed TLS certificate. Generally, the server administrator creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submits it to a Certificate Authority (CA); the CA verifies the CSR and issues a digital certificate. Once the (signed) certificate is received, it can be used to identify the server (or the client) to others, who can confirm the validity of the signature. For a host to confirm the validity of a signed certificate, the certificates of the signing authorities need to be installed on the host. In the non-digital world, this is similar to recognising the stamps of various authorities

Generally speaking, getting a certificate signed requires paying an annual fee. However, Let’s Encrypt allows you to get your certificate signed for free.

Finally, we should mention that some users opt to create a self-signed certificate. A self-signed certificate cannot prove the server’s authenticity as no third party has confirmed it.

## SSH

**Tatu Ylönen** developed the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and released SSH-1 in **1995** as freeware. (Interestingly, it was the same year that Netscape Communications released the SSL 2.0 protocol.) A more secure version, SSH-2, was defined in **1996**. In **1999**, the OpenBSD developers released OpenSSH, an open-source implementation of SSH. Nowadays, when you use an SSH client, it is most likely based on OpenSSH libraries and source code.

OpenSSH offers several benefits. We will list a few key points:

- **Secure authentication**: Besides password-based authentication, SSH supports public key and two-factor authentication.
- **Confidentiality**: OpenSSH provides end-to-end encryption, protecting against eavesdropping. Furthermore, it notifies you of new server keys to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Integrity**: In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the exchanged data, cryptography also protects the integrity of the traffic.
- **Tunneling**: SSH can create a secure “tunnel” to route other protocols through SSH. This setup leads to a VPN-like connection.
- **X11 Forwarding**: If you connect to a Unix-like system with a graphical user interface, SSH allows you to use the graphical application over the network.

You would issue the command `ssh username@hostname` to connect to an SSH server. If the username is the same as your logged-in username, you only need `ssh hostname`. Then, you will be asked for a password; however, if public-key authentication is used, you will be logged in immediately.

The screenshot below shows an example of running Wireshark on a remote Kali Linux system. The argument `-X` is required to support running graphical interfaces

## SFTP & FTPS

SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol and allows secure file transfer. It is part of the SSH protocol suite and shares the same port number, 22. If enabled in the OpenSSH server configuration, you can connect using a command such as sftp username@hostname. Once logged in, you can issue commands such as get filename and put filename to download and upload files, respectively. Generally speaking, SFTP commands are Unix-like and can differ from FTP commands.

SFTP should not be confused with FTPS. You are right to think that FTPS stands for File Transfer Protocol Secure. How is FTPS secured? Yes, you are correct to estimate that it is secured using TLS, just like HTTPS. While FTP uses port 21, FTPS usually uses port 990. It requires certificate setup, and it can be tricky to allow over strict firewalls as it uses separate connections for control and data transfer.

| Protocol   | Default Port Number |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| HTTPS      | 443                 |
| SMTPS      | 465 and 587         |
| POP3S      | 995                 |
| IMAPS      | 993                 |
| SSH / SFTP | 22                  |
| FTPS       | 991                 |
